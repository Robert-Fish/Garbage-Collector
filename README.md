# Garbage-Collector
A handy little utility script to clean up the wretched downloads folder on your computer.

TLDR:
### You will need a variables.py file for this work. This script currently only works for macOS users due to different home folder structure across the different OSes so please add these variables to this file:

path='/Users/username/Downloads'
basePath='/Users/username/'
